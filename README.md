This is a calculator with GUI it is pretty straight forward
It follows operation priority
and you can get a result with n numbers are entered
you cannot enter 2 operations back to back
you cannot enter an operation when there is no number
you cannot get a result when the line ends with an operation
You cannot enter anything but numbers and operations and you can use the keyboards or the buttons on the screen
